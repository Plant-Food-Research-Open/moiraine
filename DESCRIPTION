Description: A package to facilitate the construction of reproducible pipelines to evaluate 
  and compare multi-omics integration tools. Handles import of multi-omics datasets
  and associated metadata, datasets preparation (transformation, pre-filtering, etc),
   construction of input objects for several multi-omics integration packages
  (such as mixOmics or MOFA), as well as visualisation of the results and comparison
  of different integration tools.
