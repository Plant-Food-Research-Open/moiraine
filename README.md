`moiraine` is a package for facilitating the construction of a
reproducible analysis pipeline for multi-omics data integration. It
provides functions to automate data import, pre-processing,
transformation, integration through several tools, as well as
interpretation and comparison of the integration results. It relies on
the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package to generate
reproducible workflows. `moiraine` currently supports multi-omics data
integration through:

- sPLS and DIABLO from the mixOmics package;

- sO2PLS from the omicsPLS package;

- MOFA and MEFISTO from the MOFA2 package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of moiraine from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PlantandFoodResearch/moiraine")
```

## Example

To get started, create a new analysis pipeline in your working directory
with:

``` r
library(moiraine)

create_moiraine_pipeline()
```

The [user manual](https://solid-lamp-kq546rq.pages.github.io/) provides
an in-depth walk-through of a multi-omics integration analysis with the
package.

Before using `moiraine`, we encourage you to get familiar with the
`targets` package; the [`targets`
manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) is a great place to start.
