# moiraine (development version)

- In `comparison_heatmap_corr()`, the user can now choose the legend position through the `legend_position` parameter.

- Package here has been removed from dependencies (not needed).

- `where()` function now imported from tidyselect instead of dplyr (as it required a newer version of dplyr).
